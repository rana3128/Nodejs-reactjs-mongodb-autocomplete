# Nodejs-reactjs-mongodb-autocomplete
autocomplete with nodejs and mongodb as back end and reactjs as front js


how to use it:

1. copy autocomplete.js in your reactjs project in component section. Then add this component in app.js
2. copy apiAutocomplete.js in nodejs routes folder and change query according to your schema. and set route accordingly.

i am hoping that you already know basics of Nodejs and Reactjs

or you download "react_node_autocomplete" folder than go to command line and enter to this folder than run this command
1. npm install
2. npm run client_install

and connect to your localhost mongodb data base create database and table check config folder.
